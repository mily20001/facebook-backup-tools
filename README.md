# facebook-backup-tools
Wonder how many messages you have written on facebook? Maybe you like looking at charts? With this tools you can do this, and many more!
Before using server.js you need to install nodejs module called 'websocket'

# Parsing
Download copy of your data from facebook, unzip, and place messages.htm in the same directory as parse_to_JSON.js and run js file using node. It will generate parsed.json, which will contain all your conversations parsed to JSON format. More functions coming soon!

# Viewing numbers and charts
After parsing messages you can launch server.js, which will allow you to view stats about your messaging. Currently website is in alpha stage, and it will change a lot soon. If you want to use it, enter localhost:8097 and fill little form :)
